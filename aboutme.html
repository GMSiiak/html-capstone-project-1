      I am curious and open-minded young woman from a small Baltic country in
      the north of eastern Europe called Estonia. As it can get very cold,
      rainy,cloudy and depressing in the north, I usually spend all my free time
      somewhere sunny and warm. I really love travelling and consider it as my
      biggest hobbies. I also like to dance and go practise bachata or salsa
      with my husband. My big passion is also cooking and I try to get better
      and more versatile when I find the time to cook.I find myself good at
      problem-solving and do not stress easily.
